# Machine Learning

@evelgab

Checkout F# Snippets (it's like gists on steroiods.)

## The project
- F# Snippets is a cool website, but it's impossible to find anything (see tags).
- 1600 snippets; 1100 tags.
- Google isn't good at searching for codes.
- Let's make something better!
- Go have a look at Hoogle!

## Be Warned
- Machine learning only learns to map inputs to outputs.
- Highly dependent on training data; so always biased on inputs.
- Machine learning is about predicting things.
- You need a lot of data.
- Simple algorithms are much more predictables.

## 1: Finding Related
- Link by common terms; by a bag of words assumption.
- Must learn to ignore common terms; identify meaning fall. Thus normalised raw counts.

## 2: Linking tags with snippets
- See Naive Bayes.

## My Problems?
- Do you really need to do it? Simple approximations are better.
- Collect your data.
- Feature engineering -> Is the difficult bit.
- Actual machine learning => Normally library based.
- Put it into production
- Profit!

##Â Understand your Domain
- Do you really need a custom system
- Domain representation
- What are important features?
