Code for @dylanbeattie's Asynchronous Programming Workshop
==========================================================

Progressive.NET Tutorials 2016
------------------------------

### Workshop 1: Async and Await in .NET

* Code is in the Housework project
* It's a .NET console application that simulates... HOUSEWORK!
* We're going to use async and await to model doing the cleaning whilst the washing machine and the tumble dryer are running
* See how quickly you can complete the day's chores by making the cleaning tasks asynchronous - but no cheating!

### Workshop 2: Promises in Javascript

You'll need a browser that supports JS Promises - example code has been tested in recent versions of Chrome and Firefox, so if it's not working for you try one of those.

* Code is in the Keyquest project
* Instructions are in /Content/keyquest.html

### What else is here?

* Single-threaded JavaScript demo (in Keyquest/Content/norris.html)
* APM example (in the APM project)
* BackgroundWorkerDemo (in the BackgroundWorkerDemo project)
